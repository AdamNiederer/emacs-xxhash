* emacs-xxhash
Hash things really really fast, from emacs!

This library is an emacs lisp wrapper around the wonderful [[https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash][libxxhash]].

** Setup
First, make sure your copy of emacs was compiled with the `--with-modules` flag,
and has a version greater than or equal to 25.1

Then, compile the library:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  make
  cp xxh.so $EMACS_LOAD_PATH
#+END_SRC

To use the library from emacs:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require 'xxh)
  (xxh-64-str "Hello, world!")
#+END_SRC
** Functions
- ~(xxh-64 vec)~ - Return a hex string of representing the 64-bit hash of
  ~vec~. ~vec~ must be a vector, and each value in the vector must be a number
  less than 255 (if it's not, all bits higher than 8 are ignored)
- ~(xxh-64-str str)~ - Return a hex string representing the 64-bit hash of
  ~vec~. ~vec~ must be a string.
- ~(xxh-32 vec)~ - Return a hex string of representing the 32-bit hash of
  ~vec~. ~vec~ must be a vector, and each value in the vector must be a number
  less than 255 (if it's not, all bits higher than 8 are ignored)
- ~(xxh-32-str str)~ - Return a hex string representing the 32-bit hash of
  ~vec~. ~vec~ must be a string.
